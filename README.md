## End to End Machine Learning Project
This is an end to end project where I implemented a simple Student performance indicator in modular way. I have done data ingestion, transformation and model trainer all in a modular approach. I have also created a very simple webpage using flask to show the prediction. Then I have deployed it to AWS using elastics beanstalk and completed my CD pipeline. User interface looks like this.
